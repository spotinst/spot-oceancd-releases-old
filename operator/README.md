# Operator YAMLs

### Warning

Such files are not for personal purposes. These are used during the operator installation when done via UI. 

By applying them manually, you will not be able to install the Ocean CD Operator. Indeed, beyond the syntax of the YAML files, unique credentials are being automatically added to the file downloaded via the UI or API and thus may not be done manually.
