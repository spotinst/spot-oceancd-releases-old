# Operator YAMLs

###Warning
Such files are not for personal use purposes. These are used by the UI during the operator installation when done via UI. 

By applying them manually, you will not be able to install our Ocean CD Operator. Indeed, beyond the syntax of the YAML files, unique credentials are being automatically added to the file downloaded and thus may not be done manually.
